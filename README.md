ZeroFoodWaste is my first iOS application that I developed for my iOS application development unit. The development of this application was guided by lab tutorials provided by the university as well as StackOverflow responses and Youtube tutorials.

This application was created with the idea of reducing food waste by providing a platform for users to give away any excess food products they have. It functions similarly as a markeyplace application where users upload a listing and other users may reserve it to take it off their hands, free of charge. 

Given that it is my first application, there are many functionalities that I have yet been able to include and there are still several bugs within it. I hope to improve the application when I have the time and resources in the future, as well as use this as a stepping stone for me to branch out into other application development projects.
